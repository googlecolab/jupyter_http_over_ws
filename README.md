# Jupyter HTTP-over-WebSocket

This Jupyter server extension allows running Jupyter notebooks that use a
WebSocket to proxy HTTP traffic. Browsers do not allow cross-domain
communication to localhost via HTTP, but do support cross-domain communication
to localhost via WebSocket.

## Installation and Setup

Run the following commands in a shell:

```shell
pip install jupyter_http_over_ws
# Optional: Install the extension to run every time the notebook server starts.
# Adds a /http_over_websocket endpoint to the Tornado notebook server.

# For jupyter server (JupyterLab)
jupyter server extension enable --py jupyter_http_over_ws

# For jupyter notebook
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyter_http_over_ws
```

## Usage

New notebook servers are started normally, though you will need to set a flag to
explicitly trust WebSocket connections from the host communicating via
HTTP-over-WebSocket.

```shell
# jupyter server
jupyter server \
  --ServerApp.allow_origin='https://www.example.com' \
  --port=8081

# jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook \
  --NotebookApp.allow_origin='https://www.example.com' \
  --port=8081
```

Note: Before requests will be accepted by your Jupyter notebook, make sure to
open the browser window specified in the command-line when the notebook server
starts up. This will set an auth cookie that is required for allowing requests
(http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html).

## Troubleshooting

### Receiving 403 errors when attempting connection

If the auth cookie isn't present when a connection is attempted, you may see a
403 error. To help prevent these types of issues, consider starting your Jupyter
server using the `--no-browser` flag and open the provided link that appears in
the terminal from the same browser that you would like to connect from:

```shell
# jupyter server
jupyter server \
  --ServerApp.allow_origin='https://www.example.com' \
  --port=8081
  --no-browser

# jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook \
  --NotebookApp.allow_origin='https://www.example.com' \
  --port=8081
  --no-browser
```

If you still see issues, consider retrying the above steps from an incognito
window which will prevent issues related to browser extensions.

## Uninstallation

The jupyter server extension can be disabled and removed by running the
following commands in a shell:

```shell
# jupyter server
jupyter server extension disable --py jupyter_http_over_ws

# jupyter notebook
jupyter serverextension disable --py jupyter_http_over_ws

pip uninstall jupyter_http_over_ws
```
